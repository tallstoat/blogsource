A friend introduced me to [scratch](http://scratch.mit.edu/) today. I wrote a trivial program with it - A plane falling down on an unassuming unaware kitty, with sound effects of course.

My kid loves it and I had fun writing it; if I can only use the term __write__. It's more like playing with [lego](http://www.lego.com). Very nice medium for teaching programming to kids!

Of course, its all based on [squeak](http://www.rowledge.org/tim/squeak/OE-Tour.html); another horse from the time-ravaged [smalltalk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk) stables; a language which offers among other jaw-dropping features :- 

* which methods (yes, method not classes) to package in a deployment unit, 
* which version of classes (and methods) to deploy, 
* add behavior to any class (yes, anything/nothing is sacred); and this one is fun,
* bend the smalltalk grammer itself to your iron will. 

Ah, one wonders what variation of man's unfathomable greed led to the sad demise of such a [wonderful thing](http://users.ipa.net/~dwighth/smalltalk/byte_aug81/design_principles_behind_smalltalk.html) - and of course led to the ugliness I have to deal with day in and day out.

Java.

Programming could have been so much more fun!
