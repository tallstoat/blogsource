This is the repo holding the code used to generate my personal site [here](https://tallstoat.github.io/)

## Working with hugo

This is how you work with hugo:

* Start hugo server in this dir with 'hugo server'. Site will be accessible on http://localhost:1313
* Make changes to any files in this dir; hugo reloads the site in browser
* Generate the blog site with 'hugo -d <destination>'
* Check if the site is generated properly by going to <destination> dir, running 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080' and checking in browser at http://localhost:8080

That's pretty much it!
